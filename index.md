### Bio
------------------------------------
I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Madras School of Economics, Chennai, India. I work primarily in the area of Environmental Economics, focusing on issues relating to climate change. I have been trained as an economist. My research interests are mostly interdisciplinary in nature. I received my Ph.D. Degree in Economics from the University of Madras, Chennai for my Doctoral thesis titled **Economic Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation in Indian Agriculture** which aims to assess the physical impacts of historical weather sensitivity of rice crop and estimate the costs of adapting to climate change.
